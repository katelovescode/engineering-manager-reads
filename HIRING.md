      "We can talk about interview strategies and coding reviews and take-home fake assignments all day, but nothing will improve until we have learned to address our own fear that we are going to hire an idiot."

  * "We need to start with the assumption that engineers are smart learners eager to know more about their craft. No, an individual may not know the specific framework you use for front-end development, but then again, there are so many that it is hard to know all of them. Engage them! Mentor them! Buy them a book!"
  * "That’s not typical in our economy, and as computer science expands in popularity, we need to ensure that the next generation of talent feels welcomed. There are far less secretly terrible engineers than we might expect if we give them mentorship and support to do great work. There is a whole group of secretly great engineers ready to be developed, if only we realized our field’s animosity."
