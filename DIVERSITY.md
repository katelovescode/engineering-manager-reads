# Diversity in Tech

Not all resources on this page address diversity from an intersectional viewpoint, so I'm grouping by marginalized identity to the best of my ability, please let me know if you see anything that should be adjusted.

## Women in Tech (largely geared toward cis white women)

* ["Being Glue."](https://www.slideshare.net/TanyaReilly/being-glue) Tanya Reilly.
* ["How Gender Bias Corrupts Performance Reviews, and What to Do About It."](https://hbr.org/2017/04/how-gender-bias-corrupts-performance-reviews-and-what-to-do-about-it) Paola Cecchi-Dimeglio.
  * Key points:
    * "Women were 1.4 times more likely to receive critical subjective feedback (as opposed to either positive feedback or critical objective feedback)."
    * "In one review I read, the manager noted, “Heidi seems to shrink when she’s around others, and especially around clients, she needs to be more self-confident.” But a similar problem —­­ confidence in working with clients —­­ was given a positive spin when a man was struggling with it: “Jim needs to develop his natural ability to work with people.”"
    * "In another pair of reviews, the reviewer highlighted the woman’s “analysis paralysis,” while the same behavior in a male colleague was seen as careful thoughtfulness: “Simone seems paralyzed and confused when facing tight deadlines to make decisions,” while “Cameron seems hesitant in making decisions, yet he is able to work out multiple alternative solutions and determined the most suitable one.”"
* ["Why Women Volunteer for Tasks That Don't Lead to Promotions."](https://hbr.org/2018/07/why-women-volunteer-for-tasks-that-dont-lead-to-promotions) Linda Babcock, Maria P. Recalde, and Lise Vesterlund.
* ["What India Can Teach Silicon Valley About Its Gender Problem."](https://www.wired.com/2014/08/silicon-valley-sexism/) Vikram Chandra.
* ["Grace Hopper and the psychological drain on the gender minority."](https://code.likeagirl.io/grace-hopper-and-the-psychological-drain-on-the-gender-minority-be3ff348f2ff) Ryan Schoen.
  * A man writes about his experience attending Grace Hopper, the largest conference for women in computing (10-15k attendees yearly). His description matches a lot of the psychological effects that most people whose gender is in the minority in tech feel daily.
  * "Naturally, the line was mostly women — I had expected that. But of the perhaps 100 people in line that I could see, I couldn’t see another man. My normally logical brain switched off and gave way to a much more neurotic amygdala, flooding me with questions of self-doubt and a tinge of panic. Had I misjudged this conference? Maybe men weren’t actually welcome to attend? Maybe the fact that I got a ticket was a mistake, and now all the women were looking at me wondering what tricks I had pulled to get in? I glanced down at my conference badge — clearly it had my name, I was supposed to be there. Maybe I had just chosen the wrong line, some sort of privileged line for women?"
  * "Not only was I a man, but I was a man who clearly had no respect for the rules. And that’s when the next realization hit me. My natural habitat is as far from the spotlight as I can reasonably be. Except that for the next three days, not only was I a minority, but I was a very visible minority. I stuck out. I was easily noticed, easily remembered. There was no way I could participate in one of my favorite and most comforting activities: fading well into the background."
* ["Why Do So Many Incompetent Men Become Leaders?"](https://hbr.org/2013/08/why-do-so-many-incompetent-men) Tomas Chamorro-Premuzic.
  * "There is now compelling scientific evidence for the notion that women are more likely to adopt more effective leadership strategies than do men. Most notably, in a comprehensive review of studies, Alice Eagly and colleagues showed that female managers are more likely to elicit respect and pride from their followers, communicate their vision effectively, empower and mentor subordinates, and approach problem-solving in a more flexible and creative way (all characteristics of “transformational leadership”), as well as fairly reward direct reports."
* ["Hire More Women in Tech."](https://www.hiremorewomenintech.com/)
  * A great summation of all the research on why women are underrepresented in tech, followed by a much, much larger link collection than this one linking to the sources of all the information. You could probably spend months reading things linked to this page. Worth at least a pass through the front page of it if you're interested in trying to contribute to getting more women in tech.
