# Engineering Manager Reads

A curated list of articles about engineering management, divided into topics

## Notes

I have not yet read all of these articles.  At least one of these articles is listed with notes/quotes that include ableist language. I've added content warnings to the article and spoiler'ed that language in the pull quote where I've found it.  As I find other oppressive language in articles, I will update the list with the appropriate content warnings.  Please let me know if you catch one I've missed.
