# Learning to Manage
* ["A Voight-Kampff Test for Identifying Engineering Managers."](https://hackernoon.com/a-voight-kampff-test-for-identifying-engineering-managers-bb8512c70857) Nick Caldwell.
* ["Questions for our first 1:1."](https://larahogan.me/blog/first-one-on-one-questions/) Lara Hogan.
* ["One-on-ones are my most valuable meetings; here's how I run them."](https://medium.com/swlh/one-on-ones-are-my-most-valuable-meetings-heres-how-i-run-them-d9ae7c64dade) Mathilde Collin.
  * Great fodder for career conversations.
* ["101 Questions to Ask in One on Ones."](https://jasonevanish.com/2014/05/29/101-questions-to-ask-in-1-on-1s/) Jason Evanish.
* ["How To Tell If You're A Good Manager."](https://qz.com/work/1447711/how-to-tell-if-youre-a-good-manager/) Cate Huston.
* ["The Manager's Path."](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920056843.do) Camille Fournier.
  * Written as a reference manual for the various situations you encounter on your way through a career path in tech that leans towards management. It's a bit YMMV, but her advice rings true with a lot of what you'll run into.
* ["Radical Candor."](https://www.radicalcandor.com/) Kim Scott.
  * More of a leadership philosophy than anything else. I like her encouragement to both "Care Personally" and "Challenge Directly" in communications at work, her stories of how she did this successfully in her career in tech, and how she thinks about building consensus. Filled with interesting anecdotes on how to manage effectively.
